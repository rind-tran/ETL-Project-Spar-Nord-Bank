# ETL-Project-Spar-Nord-Bank

## About this project

**Spar Nord Bank** is trying to observe the withdrawal behavior and the corresponding dependent factors to optimally manage the refill frequency. Apart from this, other insights also have to be drawn from the data.

Spar Nord Bank has data from more than 100 ATMs across DenMark. Data is captured every transaction including withdrawn amount, card type, location, date, time, ATM type, etc.

Spar Nord Bank need to build a Dimensional Model datastore (ATM Data Mart) on this ATM transaction data to understand the ATM usage pattern.
